## Social-Web-Mining
We expect to upload the slides, Q&As, and videolinks for student team presentations in the Senior Seminar course at FAU, Boca Raton, FL, during spring 2015. Students will document APIs, case studies, and any social/cultural/regulatory/econommic/safety/privacy/financial  consequences/issues due the availability of these APIs. 
Topics may come from the following: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Github, Moodle, Yahoo, NetFlix,  Amazon, and government sites such as data.gov, and those of EPA, NOAA, NIH (Pubmed, UMLS), CDC, and AHRQ.
