### Senior Seminar on Social-Web
Welcome to the Github site of the Senior Seminar class in Spring 2015!
Student groups will have individual subfolders that the groups will have edit rights to. 

Student groups are expected to upload their slides, Q&As, and videolinks for their team presentations in the Senior Seminar course at FAU, Boca Raton, FL, during spring 2015. Students will document APIs, case studies, and any social/cultural/regulatory/econommic/safety/privacy/financial  consequences/issues due the availability of these APIs. 
Topics may come from the following: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Github, Moodle, Yahoo, NetFlix,  Amazon, and government sites such as data.gov, and those of EPA, NOAA, NIH (Pubmed, UMLS), CDC, and AHRQ.
Actual topic and student list will be posted soon. 
#### Schedule
Schdule:
2/6/15 - Twitter; 
2/13/15 - Paypal; 
2/20/15 - Github; 
2/27/15 - Amazon Cloud; 
3/13/15 - Amazon Retail;

3/27/15 - NetFlix; 
4/3/15 - LinkedIn; and

#### Logistics
Logistics: Post your Slides at Github within 3 days of the class presentation. Each group will post a question within 2 weeks of the presentation to the group in the issues section. There is a thread specific to that group. The specific group has 2 weeks after that to post their responses. For the last two groups, these schedules will overlap (reason: the semester will end soon after). Each group should use the Wiki to document the task allocation and communication within the group. This will be referred to later on to understand why a group did not meet the class expectations. Each group should provide an overview of their topic (2 lines) and a link to their video (to be uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo) in their readme section. Use LinkedIn to post quick comments/concerns/Github UNs. Do not send these to my email address - I get much too much email there and I may not even see your email there. 

#### Guidelines
Presentation: The presentation should spend about half of the time on the APIs and other technical info; and the other half on case studies, social/ethical/legal/financial issues etc. Weave them together as you see fit. Both partners should take part in the presentation. It never hurts just to chat with me or other professors/students on the topic you plan to present on. You might be surprised about finding new insights. 

#### Focus
It is always a good idea to ask why, what, and when. We focus in engineering more on 'how'- but this course is supposed to help you complete the picture by asking other types of questions. Show me that you did think about the other aspects that go beyond technology, but nevertheless are important for the success the company/entity has had. Note also that the topics are on the social web (social interaction + web 2.0 technologies). You have to ask yourself how is this company/entity a web 2.0 entity, and not a web 1.0 entity. Refer to O'Reilly's online document on this (shared in the class - see the items at Blackboard).

####Slides
You can cover about one slide per each minute. So, for a 40 minute presentation, you would need 35 to 40 slides, not more or less. Slides should not have more than 6 lines/ slide, if you are conveying info that needs to be read. Use larger font so folks at the back can actually read. Split slides that require you to emphasize the info on the screen. I will get a laser pointer for use in your presentation.  Avoid reading from the screen as much as possible. Practice once or twice before presenting in front of the class. Visuals are always helpful. Too much text can be challenging for the audience. 

If you need a Mac HDMI adapter, let me know ahead of time.
